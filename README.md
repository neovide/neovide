This is a simple graphical user interface for [Neovim](https://github.com/neovim/neovim) (an
aggressively refactored and updated Vim editor). Where possible there are some graphical
improvements, but functionally it should act like the terminal UI.

To checkout all the **cool features**, **installation instructions**, **configuration settings** and
much more, head on over to [neovide.dev](https://neovide.dev).
