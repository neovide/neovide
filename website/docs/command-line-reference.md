# Command Line Reference

Neovide supports a few command line arguments for effecting things which couldn't be set using
normal vim variables.

`$` in front of a word refers to it being an "environment variable" which is checked for, some
settings only require it to be set in some way, some settings also use the contents.

## Information

### Version

```sh
--version or -V
```

Prints the current version of neovide.

### Help

```sh
--help or -h
```

Prints details about neovide. This will be a help page eventually.

## Functionality

### Frame

```sh
--frame or $NEOVIDE_FRAME
```

Can be set to:

- `full`: The default, all decorations.
- `none`: No decorations at all. NOTE: Window cannot be moved nor resized after this.
- (macOS only) `transparent`: Transparent decorations including a transparent bar.
- (macOS only) `buttonless`: All decorations, but without quit, minimize or fullscreen buttons.

### Geometry

```sh
--geometry=<width>x<height>
```

Sets the initial neovide window size in characters.

### Log File

```sh
--log
```

Enables the log file for debugging purposes. This will write a file next to the executable
containing trace events which may help debug an issue.

### Maximized

```sh
--maximized or $NEOVIDE_MAXIMIZED
```

Maximize the window on startup, while still having decorations and the status bar of your OS
visible.

This is not the same as `g:neovide_fullscreen`, which runs Neovide in "exclusive fullscreen",
covering up the entire screen.

### Multigrid

```sh
--multigrid or $NEOVIDE_MULTIGRID
```

This enables neovim's multigrid functionality which will also enable floating window blurred
backgrounds and window animations. For now this is disabled due to some mouse input bugs upstream
([neovim/neovim/pull/12667](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/pull/12667),
[neovim/neovim/issues/15075](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/issues/15075)) and some
[floating window transparency issues](https://github.com/neovide/neovide/issues/720).

### No Fork

```sh
--nofork
```

By default, neovide detaches itself from the terminal. Instead of spawning a child process and
leaking it, be "blocking" and have the shell directly as parent process.

### No Idle

```sh
--noidle or $NEOVIDE_NO_IDLE
```

Instead of skipping some frames in order to match `g:neovide_refresh_rate`, render every possible
one.

### No sRGB

```sh
--nosrgb or $NEOVIDE_NO_SRGB
```

Don't request sRGB on the window. Swapping sometimes fixes startup issues.

### No Tabs

```sh
--notabs
```

By default, Neovide opens files given directly to Neovide (not NeoVim through `--`!) in multiple
tabs to avoid confusing new users. The option disables that and makes multiple given files to normal
buffers.

Note: Even if files are opened in tabs, they're buffers anyways. It's just about them being visible
or not.

### Remote TCP

```sh
--remote-tcp <remote_tcp>
```

What IP and port to use when connecting to neovim.

### WSL

```sh
--wsl
```

Runs neovim from inside wsl rather than as a normal executable.

### Neovim Binary

```sh
--neovim-bin or $NEOVIM_BIN
```

Sets where to find neovim's executable. If unset, neovide will try to find `nvim` on the `PATH`
environment variable instead. If you're running a Unix-alike, be sure that binary has the executable
permission bit set.

### Wayland / X11

```sh
--wayland-app-id <wayland_app_id> or $NEOVIDE_APP_ID
--x11-wm-class-instance <x11_wm_class_instance> or $NEOVIDE_WM_CLASS_INSTANCE
--x11-wm-class <x11_wm_class> or $NEOVIDE_WM_CLASS
```

On Linux/Unix, this alters the identification of the window to either X11 or the more modern
Wayland, depending on what you are running on.
