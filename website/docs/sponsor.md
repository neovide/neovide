# Sponsoring

Neovide is driven by volunteers who design, code, test and support releases in their spare time.
Financial sponsorship gives maintainers predictable time and resources to keep improving the project,
triage bug reports faster and invest in long-term architectural improvements.

Sponsorship also helps cover recurring costs such as code-signing certificates and the hardware
needed to verify Neovide works well across macOS, Windows and Linux.

## GitHub Sponsors

You can sponsor the project directly through [GitHub Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/neovide)
which exposes multiple tiers so individuals and companies can choose a monthly contribution that
matches their budget. One-time contributions are also supported if you just want to say thanks for a
recent bug fix or release.

Every contribution signals that Neovide is valuable to you. That feedback helps us prioritize
features, fix pain points and justify the time we spend supporting the community.

## Other ways to support

Not everyone can contribute money and that's fine! You can still help by:

- Improving documentation;
- Sharing reproducible bug reports and feature requests;
- Joining the commnity and help other users in [Discord](https://discord.gg/SjFpZdQys6) or on [Matrix](https://matrix.to/#/#neovide:matrix.org);
- Sharing blog posts about your workflow using Neovide;

These contributions keep the project healthy and often unlock new releases faster than funding
alone. Whatever form your support takes, thank you for helping Neovide thrive.
